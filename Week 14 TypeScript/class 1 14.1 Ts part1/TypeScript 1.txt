2 types of languages
- Strongly Typed 
- Loosely Typed

People realised that javascript is a very power language, but lacks types. Typescript was introduced as a new language to add types on top of javascript.
 

Where/How does typescript code run?

Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 

    Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)

    Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript

    When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails. 




Typescript compiler

tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
There are many other famous compilers/transpilers for converting Typescript to Javascript. Some famous ones are - 

    esbuild
    
    swc
